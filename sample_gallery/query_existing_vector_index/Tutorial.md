```
To query existing vector indexes in a PromptFlow standard flow, a [Vector DB Lookup
tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/tools-reference/vector-db-lookup-tool?view=azureml-api-2) is required. This tool
is a wrapper for Azure AI Search as well as multiple third-party vector databases such as Qdrant and Weaviate.

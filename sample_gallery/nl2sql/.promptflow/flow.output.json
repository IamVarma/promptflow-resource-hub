The query follows these steps:\n\n1. Use the INNER JOIN clause to combine rows from the `Customer`, `CustomerAddress` and `Address` tables, based on their logical relationships:\n    - `Customer.CustomerID` and `CustomerAddress.CustomerID`\n    - `CustomerAddress.AddressID` and `Address.AddressID`\n2. Use the WHERE clause to filter the results. Only rows where the Address.City column equals 'Dallas' are included in the results.\n3. The SELECT statement specifies `Customer.CompanyName` as the column to be returned in the result set. \n   \nSo, the overall query is joining three tables together to find the customer's company name where the customer has an address in the city of 'Dallas'.\n*/\n"

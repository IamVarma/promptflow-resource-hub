It starts by selecting the CompanyName column from the SalesLT.Customer table.\n\n2. It then joins the Customer table with the CustomerAddress table on the CustomerID field, which is the common identifier linking customers to their addresses. This brings in the address information for each customer.\n\n3. After joining CustomerAddress, it further joins this result with the Address table on the AddressID field, which contains the specific details of each address including the city.\n\n4. A 'WHERE' clause is then used to filter out the results to only include rows where the City column in the Address table is 'Dallas'. This narrows down the result to only include customers who have an address in Dallas.\n*/\n"
